# Jsp-Sum-Training-With-Redirection
JSP Sum Training with Redirecting This module builds upon basic JSP sum training by adding functionality to redirect the user after submitting the form. It includes two input fields and a submit button, and upon submission, the result is displayed on a different JSP page via redirection.
